# About SushiChefGame
I wrote this game in my Advanced Programming in Java class. This game allows a player (you) to create sushi and compete against other chefs in trying to get customers to eat your sushi.

# How to Use
The user starts off the game. This is done by hitting the "Make some Sushi!" button in the top right corner of the window. Go through the steps of making sushi. 

Click on a belt space at any time to see its position. If the sushi is successfully placed, the color of your plate will appear in the position you specified, otherwise, it will give you an error at the bottom left of the window. The cost of making the sushi will then be subtracted from your initial balance of $100. 

Click the rotate button in the bottom left of the window to make one rotation (move sushi over one space) and see if a customer eats the sushi. If the sushi is eaten, the plate will be removed from the screen and the price of that sushi will be added to your balance. Note that once you hit rotate, the chefs will also begin randomly making and placing plates. If a plate is determined to be spoiled (each plate and sushi combo has different spoilage times) meaning it has been on the sushi belt too long, it will be removed from the screen. Do this over and over. 

Sort the chefs and user by balance, amount consumed, or amount spoiled at any time by clicking on the drop-down menu in the bottom left of the screen.

There is no end to the game so play as much as you want!

# Design Pattern
All classes in the game follow the MVC architecture

# Other Info
I wrote 80% of the code in this game. The other 20% was supplied by my professor KMP.
